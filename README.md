## Project Goals:
* Build a GUI to uptake new user information and inputs. 
* Read in 1) numerical survey 2) categorical survey data for users into complex data structures in Python.
* Use machine learning and pattern recognition via the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm to determine top matches.
* Calculate Simularity Scores using Euclidean Distances and plot similarity.
* Extend GUI for visual display of plotted outputs for BestieBubbles&trade;.

## Project Achievements
GUI for personality quiz that takes user input, runs matching algorithm against database, and displays images of matches.
Matching algorithm that matches user input with database of personality traits (numerical data)
Script to convert csv to multilayered dictionary
Scripts to make spider plots of individual traits vs top 3 matches
Command line science quiz that takes user input (categorical instead of numerical), runs matching algorithm against database, and saves image of matches.

## Future Directions
GUI for science quiz
Use real data for science database instead of randomized traits (actually match to a potential PI!)
Refinement of personality matching algorithm
Increase number of possible questions for both personality and science quizzes
Allow user to rank importance of traits
